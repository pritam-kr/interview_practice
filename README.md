# interview_practice

// HTML page contains the following form:
// Write a setup function that registers a click handler and implements the following logic:
// When a button with id double is clicked, the value of the text field with id value should be doubled.
// If the value of the text field is not numeric, the button click should set it to 1.
// Ye chit chat mai mast question mila muzhe

// Create a web app where user can input his/her name and a colour. (put a list of colours from which user can choose one ). On clicking the button, show the name with the same colour which user has entered.

Ishan and Shivam mock interview:
Conceptual: Started with DOM explaination then shifted towards API and semantic HTML description
Coding: Build a counter application (done using JS) and then some questions related to the coding part

Pranshu and Saksham mock interview:
CODING: Started with a coding question about input getting disabled if more than 50 characters are entered looks like something more was asked but couldn't understand
Conceptual: Difference between inline and inline-block

Bharati and Supriya mock interview;
Coding : Started with coding question where we had to fetch an API: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos and display it on the output on screen(done using JS)
Conceptual: Explain about promises and ways of linking stylesheet to our html file

Mock Interview(30/10/2021):
Akshay Rajput and Divya Devi (conducted on #ttone voice channel started at around 1 pm):

Coding:

Refer to https://npmjs.com/ on the top navbar at the left there is a heart shaped icon which when clicked returns 3 words every now on each click and the first character taken from each of the 3 words forms "NPM"
So what Akshay wanted Divya to do was to have a button in the display which on every click show a random word from a list of words
(Divya did it using Vanilla JS on Vscode)
Hint: use the inbuilt function random from Math library for solving it

Conceptual:

1. State the use of addEventListener. What are the parameters that are passed inside the addEventListener?Describe about them

Feedback:
1)Utilize technical terms while explaining the concepts 2) If one gets stuck while solving the problem in between then explain your approach to the interviewer so that he can help you out

Akshay Rajput and Kevin Solomon:
Coding:
Create a password checker web app.If the length of the password is less than 10 characters then show an error message and if its length is greater then show the
message "Password is valid"
Followup: If there is nothing in the input section then no message should be shown
(Kevin does it using Vanilla JS on stackblitz)

Conceptual:

1. Distinguish between innerHTML and innerText.
2. What are Semantic Elements?

Feedback:
1)Utilize technical terms while explaining the concepts

Mock Interviews(30/10/2021):
Both were taken by Ishan Jirety(NeoGrad):

1. With Krituraj Anand:
   Coding:
   you have to create a profit and loss calculator, in which you will make two input sections one will take current price and other one will take the cost price and to show result one will click on a button and a message will be shown, if there is loss then you just have to show a message with loss amount and similarly for profit

(Krituraj did it using Vanilla JS on VSCODE)
Conceptual:

1. Reason of placing the script tag at the bottom in index.html file.
2. Within querySelector you have used class selector .Are we allowed to try something else like "id"?
3. Difference between class and id
4. Speak about the box model
5. What's the feature of React that you like most?

Feedback:

1. Be ready with your code editor
2. Engage with your interviewer

3. With Pratiyush:
   Coding:
   Here is an API: https://otpgenerator.ishanjirety.repl.co/get-otp?name= . You will enter a name as input from your app and send this API a request with the name along with it (this will be the final URL : https://otpgenerator.ishanjirety.repl.co/get-otp?name=Nameentered) on button click . In the response you will get an OTP which should be shown on the screen.

Followup1: Make another input section that asks the user to guess the OTP and for checking whether the guess is equal to the actual one or not add a button "Validate" which on clicking shows the message "Success " or "Failure" depending . Response is coming in the form of Name-OTP format so something like Pratyush-570928.So compare the OTP value from the response as well as the input which is being entered

Followup2: Change the color of validate message to GREEN when success comes up and change it to RED if failure comes up on click of Validate Button.

(done using Vanilla JS on VScode)
Conceptual:

1. Speak about DOM.
2. Speak about the use of Fetch in your application.
3. What do you think Javascript is synchronous or asynchronous?

// Create a web app which will have 2 input fields.. in 1st input, user can enter a sentence. In 2nd input, user can enter a word. Now if word is present in sentence, then display: found.. else display not found. And the display should work as soon as u enter the text in 2nd input field

// Here' an API. It will give an error. Write a web app, call this API and read the error message. Show the name of the error (not whole error). API

//You need to create three input fields and an output field.
// First, two input fields will take numbers as input. The last input field will take the operator as input. // Operators are +, -, × and /. If the third input field value is + then show in the output field the sum of the first input value + second input value. Similarly, if we enter ×, - and / in the third input field. // Note: Button is not required. for this question: limit the last input field to take only +,-,× and /. Show error if user gives any other input.

// Another question: // You have to create a counter.
// Create two buttons + and -. On clicking the + button increment the counter. Similarly for -. // Now highlight the counter:
// i. If the counter value is multiple of 3 then highlight the counter with Red colour.
// ii. If the counter value is multiple of 5 then highlight it with Green colour. // iii. If the counter value is multiple of both 5 and 3 then highlight it with Yellow colour.

// You have to create a text field and three button. // Suppose your input text is github. ,// On clicking the first button the text should become like this GITHUB. // On clicking the second button the text should become like this Github. // On clicking the third button the text should become like this github.

// Create a password checker. When char goes above 10, input border should become green. Now create a button. On clicking the button, show/hide the password. ( change ......... to text and vice versa. ) HINT - you need to change the type of input field...........for this question, it works only when the cursor is outside of the input field, when cursor inside its yellow, how to change that?
