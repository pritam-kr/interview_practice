//  add more characters after a certain limit has been reached(deleting 
// characters is still possible).He asked Saksham to disable the button 
// when the text area is empty and enable it when something is typed.

// As an extension of this, you can also cover the edge case that the 
// button should remain disabled if there are only spaces in the text area.
